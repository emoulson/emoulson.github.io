Details are still sketchy about today's explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.  What we do know, however, is that within minutes of the blasts, Tufts students, Bostonians, and people around the world were working together to ensure the safety of those at the scene.

Tufts students are traditionally heavily involved in the marathon -- either running it, or cheering on those who are -- so today's event's are particularly shocking for those of us who had friends there.  If you want more news about the incidents, go to a news site or Twitter.  This is a blog of student perspectives.

My perspective is to deal with this tragedy through poetry and human connections.  If, like me, you are currently seeking some kind of comfort and solidarity from humanity, if you asked, "how could this happen?" after you heard the news, then these are for you:

*Soldier's Dream*

Wilfred Owen

>I dreamed kind Jesus fouled the big-gun gears;
And caused a permanent stoppage in all bolts;
And buckled with a smile Mausers and Colts;
And rusted every bayonet with His tears.

>And there were no more bombs, of ours or Theirs,
Not even an old flint-lock, nor even a pikel.
But God was vexed, and gave all power to Michael;
And when I woke he'd seen to our repairs.

*since feeling is first*

e.e. cummings

>since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

>my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry
â€”the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

>we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

>And death i think is no parenthesis
