My posts are almost exclusively long-ish essay format things on economics, politics, social justice, or similar topics.  But that’s not all I do!

To prove it to you, I present (and this is a rare thing) a piece of poetry I wrote, using Mitt Romney’s RNC speech as a base.  Omission poetry crosses out some words but retains the order of the original work to create poetry.

If you’re interested in omission poetry, I encourage you to read the book that turned me onto the genre, Srikanth Reddy’s *[Voyager](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/arts/mondays-poem-from-srikanth-reddys-voyager/28607)*, which omits words from the autobiography of former UN Secretary General (and Nazi intelligence officer) Kurt Waldheim.

Here you go:

> *Mittens*

I trust America America America
Confidence lights the world
Possibilities come after
United over air

The children who woke up at night
Immigrants knelt and kissed tyranny
None doubted America America America America America
Every good job deserved it

You.
Get a second job.  Work harder.  Do with less.  Work longer.
I want to stand up and say,
“Go to the Moon. God bless the Moon. You need Mexico.”
Unconditional hearts and arms.

I am in love with cars.  Those were tough days for Ann.
We don’t apologize for China.
Cut, reduce, balance, rein, repeal, replace
Honor the slow rise of the oceans.

The dictator is still spinning.
I lift eyes to destiny
to
God God God
American America.
